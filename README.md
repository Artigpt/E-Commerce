This webpage is a simple and responsive resume designed for showcasing your personal and professional details. It is built using **HTML** and styled with **CSS**. The webpage is divided into different sections to organize the information clearly. Here's how it works:

The **HTML code** creates the structure of the webpage. At the top, the "Head" section contains the page title, information about how the page adjusts to different screen sizes, and a link to the external CSS file for styling. The body of the page is divided into sections, each focusing on a specific type of content.

1. **Personal Information Section**: This section displays your name, job title, email, and phone number at the top of the page. It is the first thing visitors see.

2. **About Me Section**: A short paragraph about your skills and interests is included here to introduce yourself.

3. **Skills Section**: A list of your technical and soft skills is shown. Each skill appears as a separate badge to make it visually appealing.

4. **Projects Section**: This section lists your projects with clickable links. You can add links to your live projects or GitHub repositories.

5. **Education & Experience Section**: This section highlights your academic background and work experience. It is organized as bullet points for better readability.

6. **Contact Form Section**: At the bottom of the page, there is a simple form where people can fill in their name, email, and message to contact you directly.

The **CSS code** is used to style the page and make it visually appealing. It controls the colors, fonts, layout, and spacing of elements on the page. For example:
- The text and background colors are chosen to make the content easy to read.
- Skills are arranged neatly using flexbox for responsiveness.
- Buttons and links change color when hovered over, making them interactive.

The design is responsive, meaning the webpage will adjust itself to look good on different screen sizes like phones, tablets, or laptops. You can easily change the colors, text, and layout by updating the CSS or HTML code. This simple structure is perfect for beginners to learn how to build and style a personal webpage!
